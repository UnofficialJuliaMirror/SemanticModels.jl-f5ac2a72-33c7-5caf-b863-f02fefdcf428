    "# Trace Generation and Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "To test our DeepValidate approach we generate a dataset of test traces from a chain of relatively simple arithmetical functions operating on a series of randomized inputs. Given the generated program traces, we train a LSTM classifier to predict whether the output will be valid or result in an error. \n",
    "\n",
    "The trace generation is performed by `output_trace.jl` which reproduces much of the functionality of `varextract.jl` with some important differences. Rather than send trace information to `stdout`, we direct the traces to a file `traces.dat`. \n",
    "\n",
    "(It must be noted that this is not possible within an IJulia notebook due to restrictions on [task switching in staged functions](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues/18568) which prevents the trace outputs from being written to a file recursively. However, this works just fine from the command line.)"
